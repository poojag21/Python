This Python file contains programs on Dynamic Programming,

The first question finds the longest ordered subsequences of a given numberic sequence.

The second program solves the given dynammic problem: Due to recent rains (I know it’s very rare here), water has pooled in various
places in the campus, which is represented by a rectangle of N x M (1 <= N <= 100; 1 <= M <= 100) squares. Each square 
contains either water ('#') or dry land ('-'). A pond is a connected set of squares with water in them, where a square is 
considered adjacent to all eight of its neighbors. The problem is to figure out how many ponds have formed in the campus, 
given a diagram of the campus. The campus is represented by a grid represented by a list of N lines of characters separated 
by “,”. Each line contains M characters per line representing one row of the grid (campus). Each character is either '#' or 
'-'. The characters do not have spaces between them. Write a program to compute and return the number of ponds in the campus.

The third prigram solves the below job scheduling and deadline problem:
A supermarket has a set ‘Prod’ of products on sale. It earns a profit px for each product x∈Prod sold by a deadline dx that is 
measured as an integral number of time units starting from the moment the sale begins. Each product takes precisely one unit 
of time for being sold. A selling schedule is an ordered subset of products Sell ≤ Prod such that the selling of each product 
x∈Sell, according to the ordering of Sell, completes before the deadline dx or just when dx expires. The profit of the selling 
schedule is Profit(Sell)=Σx∈Sellpx. An optimal selling schedule is a schedule with a maximum profit.
