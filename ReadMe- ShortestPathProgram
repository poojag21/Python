This Python Program file solves the shortest distance path and Minumum spanning tree using diffrent algorithms:
a. Prim Method
b. Bellman Ford
c. Dijkstra's Algorithm

It solves the network problem by creating Graph using Adjacency Matrix. I have also written a depth first search algorithm 
to find the discover and finish time of a vertices in a graph. In the find the in-degree, out-degree and transpose of a function 
is calculated.
